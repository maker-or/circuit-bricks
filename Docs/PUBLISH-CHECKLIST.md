# Pre-Publication Checklist

> **⚠️ DEVELOPMENT STATUS:** Circuit-Bricks is currently in alpha stage and not recommended for production use.

The following changes have been made to prepare Circuit-Bricks for npm publication:

## Package Structure & Configuration
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with proper metadata, repository info, and engine requirements
- ✅ Added `.npmignore` for excluding dev files from the published package
- ✅ Updated version to `0.1.1-alpha.1` to reflect development status
- ✅ Improved JSDoc comments and type declarations
- ✅ Created CHANGELOG.md with version history
- ✅ Enhanced README.md with security section and development status warnings
- ✅ Updated all documentation to clearly indicate alpha/development status

## Testing & Quality
- ✅ Fixed test setup to better handle SVG operations
- ✅ Added security audit scripts
- ✅ Verified production dependencies for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Validated build output

## Security Improvements
- ✅ No external runtime dependencies (clean dependency tree)
- ✅ All SVG content is properly handled
- ✅ Type safety throughout the codebase
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities in production dependencies

## Remaining Issues
1. Some test failures in integration tests and UI tests that should be addressed in future updates
2. The selectors in UI tests may need updating to work with JSDOM
3. Need to implement comprehensive production readiness tests
4. API stability needs to be improved before moving to beta
5. UI components require additional optimization and testing

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding ESLint for better code quality enforcement
2. Add more comprehensive API documentation
3. Create a roadmap for beta release with API stability guarantees
4. Improve error handling and provide better debug capabilities
5. Implement additional real-world testing scenarios
6. Consider a public beta program with early adopters
3. Create examples in a CodeSandbox environment
4. Improve test coverage, particularly for edge cases
5. Update circuit validation for more complex scenarios

## Publishing Instructions
To publish the package to npm:

```bash
# Log in to npm (requires npm account with proper permissions)
